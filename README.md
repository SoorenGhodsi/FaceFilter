# FaceFilter
Face Filter is a program that places select filters onto faces that are detected in the given image or the live feed.

## Motivation
We were inspired by popular Instagram and Snapchat filters and wanted to see if we could create a makeshift version of them in only two days for the 2020 Winter Hacklympics Hackathon hosted by MLH.

## Features
Face Filter uses live facial detection and image processing operations and places a filter onto each face detected by the device camera. Through a number of calculations, it determines the optimal placement, scale, and angle of the filter mask dependent on each individual face.

## Installation
### Windows
Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install cv2, numpy 1.19.13, and scipy in command prompt.
```
pip install opencv-contrib-python
pip uninstall numpy
pip install numpy==1.19.3
pip install scipy
```

### Mac OS
