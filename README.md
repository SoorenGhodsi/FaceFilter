Face Filter is a program that places select filters onto faces that are detected in the given image or the live feed.

## Motivation
We were inspired by popular Instagram and Snapchat filters and wanted to see if we could create a makeshift version of them in only two days for the 2020 Winter Hacklympics Hackathon hosted by MLH.

## Features
Face Filter uses live facial detection and image processing operations and places a filter onto each face detected by the device camera. Through a number of calculations, it determines the optimal placement, scale, and angle of the filter mask dependent on each individual face.
